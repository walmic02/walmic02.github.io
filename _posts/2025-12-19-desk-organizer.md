Over the course of the Fall 2025 semester, I designed, manufactured, and assembled a desk organizer product. It features a pencil holder, electronic clock/timer with concealed battery storage, hammer display, customized nametag, and various aspects of Purdue Pride. I was responsible for the Computer-Aided Design (CAD) and Manufacturing. Our product showcases the design and manufacturing skills gained from [ME 26400: Intro to Manufacturing and Design](https://engineering.purdue.edu/ME/Undergraduate/Files/Courses/me264.pdf).

#### Individual Responsibilities:

- Designed within manufacturing and material constraints
- Drafted detailed engineering drawings with GD&T in Solidworks
- Manufactured parts using Laser Cutters and CNC Router
- Created CAM programs in Fusion 360 for CNC router
- Created a final report and presentation


The final product requirements included: provide desk organization features; display the projects made in ME 26400 such as the hammer, clock, nametag, and engineering fountain; and incorporate Purdue Pride. My team and I were provided a very limited amount of materials and available manufacturing processes. Over the course of 6 weeks, we went through the engineering design process from conceptual design to manufacturing and assembly.
