## Overview

EPICS, or Engineering Projects In Community Service, is an organization at Purdue University in which teams of students partner with local and global community organizations to address human, community, and environmental needs. My team worked with [Wolf Park](https://visitwolfpark.org/), a local wildlife sanctuary home wolves, foxes, bison, and more.
Our task was to develop an interactive video game for their education center that met the following specifications:
- Designed for elementary to middle school children
- Educational focus on wolf behavior in the wild
- Compatible with the center’s existing computer display

Our development followed the established EPICS design process, including rigorous documentation, iterative prototyping, and stakeholder feedback integration.

## Contributions

As a member of the coding subteam within an 11-person interdisciplinary group, I was responsible for designing, implementing, and debugging core game functionality. I led technical improvements across the game’s backend, interface, and core mechanics using Python and Pygame. I redesigned the frame rate system to triple performance, implemented full-screen scaling with adaptive assets, and revamped the sound and dialogue backend with a JSON-based system for easier integration and modifiability. I independently conceived and developed the trivia-based hunting minigame, handling the concept, graphics, and logic; this transformed the core gameplay loop and became the game’s primary educational feature. I also introduced new UI features, background music, and animations to make the game feel more polished, along with numerous small bug fixes and improvements across the game.
