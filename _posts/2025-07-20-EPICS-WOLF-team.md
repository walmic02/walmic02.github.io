## Overview

EPICS, or Engineering Projects In Community Service, is an organization at Purdue University in which teams of students partner with local and global community organizations to address human, community, and environmental needs. My team worked with [Wolf Park](https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&q=wolf+park), a local wildlife sanctuary home wolves, foxes, bison, and more. 

Our task was to develop an interactive video game for their education center that met the following specifications:
- Designed for elementary to middle school children
- Educational focus on wolf behavior in the wild
- Compatible with the center’s existing computer display

## My Role

As a member of the coding subteam within an 11-person interdisciplinary group, I was responsible for designing, implementing, and debugging core game functionality using Python and PyGame.
