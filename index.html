<h1 id="welcome">Welcome</h1>
<p>I&#39;m Michael, a Mechanical Engineering undergrad at Purdue University. From my research groups and engineering clubs, to my floor community in the dorms, I'm always challenging myself to learn and grow. When I'm not at one of those activities, you'll find me playing jazz piano or doing something outside in nature.</p>

<p>This site includes some relevant engineering projects I've been a part of. Feel free to reach out with any questions!</p>
