In this project, we developed an educational, child oriented video game designed to educate players on wolf behavior in the wild. We designed it specifically for [Wolf Park](visitwolfpark.org), a local wildlife sanctuary in Battleground, IN. As part of the team, I was responsible for developing the trivia minigame, which was the game's main educational component, as well as sound implementation, animations, and more. I also optimized the frame rate, raising FPS from 15-20 to a consistent 60 FPS.

- Designed functioning educational video game for a local community partner
- Utilized Python and GitHub to collaborative on game development
- Maintained complete and consistent documentation to facilitate current and future development
- Delivered bi-semesterly presentations to update investors and stakeholders on progress

The goal of this project was simple: Wolf Park was looking for a way to enhance their education center and appeal more to young children while staying true to their mission -- to educate future generations and inspire them to protect the natural world for years to come. We worked alongside the park to make sure that every part of the game aligned with their vision. By the time we finished, they were very pleased with our product; it was fun and engaging while also providing an enriching educational experience, and also accessable for all kinds of children. Our contribution to their education center will help them connect with more children and promote the park's mission.

**Utilized Python and GitHub to collaboratively develop large scale code architecture.**
