*Wolf Game* is an educational, child oriented video game designed to educate players on wolf behavior in the wild. We designed it specifically for Wolf Park, a local wildlife sanctuary near Lafayette, IN. As part of the team, I was responsible for developing the trivia minigame, which was the game's main educational component, as well as sound implementation, animations, and more. I also optimized the frame rate, raising FPS from 15-20 to a consistent 60 FPS.
