Hi! I'm Michael Wall, a Mechanical Engineering student at Purdue University. I'm currently exploring the vast scope of Mechanical Engineering, but I'm particularly interested by how physics and mathmatics blend into engineering.

## Areas of Interest

- Control systems 
- Robotics and simulations
- Applied mathmatics and physics
- R&D

## My Values

For me, engineering is all about pushing boundaries - finding out what I'm capable of, and finding joy in every aspect of it. I'm drawn to challenges - every obstacle provides an opportunity for growth, and I genuinely enjoy pushing myself.

Outside of engineering, I play piano in the Purdue Jazz Band and enjoy going on trips with the Purdue Outing Club.
